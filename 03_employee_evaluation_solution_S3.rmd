# Libraries

First, we load the necessary libraries. These will help us with data manipulation (`tidyverse`), data display (`knitr`), and improved table styling (`kableExtra`).

```{r code_setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Data import

We start by importing our dataset. The `read_csv` function from the `tidyverse` package is used to read the `employee_data.csv` file into R. We then display the first few rows of the dataset to get a glimpse of its structure and contents.

```{r data_import, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read_csv(
  file = "employee_data.csv",
  col_types = "iccccdd"
)

data %>%
  head(n = 12) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Preview of Employee Data", 
    format = "html",
    col.names = c("Employee ID", "Name", "Department", "Designation", "Month", "Monthly Sales", "Monthly Customer Feedback Score")
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

```

# Class creation

## Employee Class

### Employee: Constructor

The Employee class represents individual employees. We begin by defining a constructor function, `create_employee`, which ensures that each employee object has the correct attributes and that these attributes meet our specifications.

```{r class_employee}
# Constructor function for the Employee class
create_employee <- function(Employee_ID, Name, Department, Designation, Monthly_Sales, Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score) {
  
  # Checks for Employee
  if (!is.integer(Employee_ID) || Employee_ID < 0) stop("Employee_ID should be a non-negative integer.")
  if (!is.character(Name) || Name == "") stop("Name should be a non-empty string.")
  if (!is.character(Department) || Department == "") stop("Department should be a non-empty string.")
  if (!is.character(Designation) || Designation == "") stop("Designation should be a non-empty string.")
  if (!is.numeric(Monthly_Sales) || any(Monthly_Sales < 0)) stop("Monthly_Sales should be a non-negative numeric vector.")
  if (!is.numeric(Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score) || any(Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score < 0) || any(Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score > 10)) 
    stop("Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score should be a numeric vector with values between 0 and 10.")
  
  # Object creation using structure
  employee <- structure(
    list(
      Employee_ID = Employee_ID,
      Name = Name,
      Department = Department,
      Designation = Designation,
      Monthly_Sales = Monthly_Sales,
      Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score = Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score
    ),
    class = "Employee"
  )
  
  return(employee)
}
```

### Employee: Methods

Next, we define methods for the `Employee` class. These methods will allow us to interact with and analyse individual employee objects. We include methods to print the employee's details (`print`), calculate their overall performance score (`performance`), summarise their yearly performance (`summary`), and visualise their monthly sales trend (`plot`).

```{r methods_employee}
# Print method for Employee class
print.Employee <- function(x, ...) {
  cat("Employee ID:", x$Employee_ID, "\n")
  cat("Name:", x$Name, "\n")
  cat("Department:", x$Department, "\n")
  cat("Designation:", x$Designation, "\n")
  cat("Monthly Sales:", toString(x$Monthly_Sales), "\n")
  cat("Monthly Customer Feedback Score:", toString(x$Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score), "\n")
  invisible(x)
}

performance.Employee <- function(employee) {
  avg_sales <- mean(employee$Monthly_Sales)
  avg_feedback <- mean(employee$Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score)
  
  standardized_sales <- avg_sales / 500
  performance_score <- (standardized_sales + avg_feedback) / 2
  return(performance_score)
}

# Summary method for Employee class
summary.Employee <- function(x, ...) {
  avg_sales <- mean(x$Monthly_Sales)
  avg_feedback <- mean(x$Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score)
  total_sales <- sum(x$Monthly_Sales)
  
  standardized_sales <- avg_sales / 500
  performance_score <- (standardized_sales + avg_feedback) / 2
  
  cat("Average Monthly Sales:", round(avg_sales, 2), "\n")
  cat("Average Monthly Customer Feedback Score:", round(avg_feedback, 2), "\n")
  cat("Total Sales for the Year:", total_sales, "\n")
  cat("Overall Performance Score:", round(performance_score, 2), "\n")
  invisible(x)
}


# Plot method for Employee class
plot.Employee <- function(x, type="o", main = "Monthly Sales Trend", xlab="Month", ylab="Sales", col="blue", ylim=c(min(x$Monthly_Sales) - 10, max(x$Monthly_Sales) + 10), ...) {
  plot(x$Monthly_Sales, type=type, main=main,
       xlab=xlab, ylab=ylab, col=col, ylim = ylim, ...)
  invisible(x)
}
```

## Designation Class

### Designation: Constructor

The `Designation` class represents a collection of employees that share the same job title. We define a constructor function, `create_designation`, to ensure that each designation object contains the required attributes and that these attributes are valid.

```{r class_department}
# Constructor function for the Designation class
create_designation <- function(Designation_Name, List_of_Employees) {
  
  # Checks for Designation
  if (!is.character(Designation_Name) || Designation_Name == "") stop("Designation_Name should be a non-empty string.")
  if (!all(sapply(List_of_Employees, function(e) inherits(e, "Employee")))) stop("List_of_Employees should contain only Employee objects.")
  
  # Object creation using structure
  designation <- structure(
    list(
      Designation_Name = Designation_Name,
      List_of_Employees = List_of_Employees
    ),
    class = "Designation"
  )
  
  return(designation)
}
```

### Designation: Methods

Now, we define methods for the `Designation` class. These methods allow us to interact with and analyse groups of employees based on their job title. We include methods to print the details of all employees within a designation (`print`), summarise the performance metrics of the designation (`summary`), and visualise the cumulative monthly sales trend of the designation (`plot`).

```{r methods_descignation}
# Print method for Designation class
print.Designation <- function(x, ...) {
  cat("Designation Name:", x$Designation_Name, "\n")
  cat("Number of Employees:", length(x$List_of_Employees), "\n")
  
  # Loop through each employee, print their details, and then print a separator
  for (emp in x$List_of_Employees) {
    # cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
    cat("---\n")
    print.Employee(emp)
  }
  
  invisible(x)
}

# Summary method for Designation class
summary.Designation <- function(x, ...) {
  avg_sales <- mean(unlist(lapply(x$List_of_Employees, function(e) mean(e$Monthly_Sales))))
  avg_feedback <- mean(unlist(lapply(x$List_of_Employees, function(e) mean(e$Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score))))
  
  top_performer <- x$List_of_Employees[[which.max(unlist(lapply(x$List_of_Employees, performance.Employee)))]]
  
  cat("Average Monthly Sales for Designation:", round(avg_sales, 2), "\n")
  cat("Average Monthly Customer Feedback Score for Designation:", round(avg_feedback, 2), "\n")
  cat("Top Performing Employee in Designation:", top_performer$Name, "\n")
  cat("Performance Score:", round(performance.Employee(top_performer), 2), "\n")
  invisible(x)
}

# Plot method for Designation class
plot.Designation <- function(x, type="o", main="Cumulative Monthly Sales Trend",
       xlab="Month", ylab="Total Sales", col="blue", ...) {
  total_monthly_sales <- colSums(do.call(rbind, lapply(x$List_of_Employees, function(e) e$Monthly_Sales)))
  plot(total_monthly_sales, type=type, main=paste("Cumulative Monthly Sales Trend for", x$Designation_Name),
       xlab=xlab, ylab=ylab, col=col, ...)
  invisible(x)
}
```

## Data Wrangling

With our classes defined, we now transform our dataset into a format suitable for object-oriented analysis. We start by converting the long-format dataset into individual `Employee` objects. Then, we group these employee objects by their designation to create `Designation` objects.

```{r}
data_nested <- data %>%
  select(-Month) %>% 
  chop(c(Monthly_Sales, Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score))

# List to hold Employee objects
list_of_employees <- vector("list", nrow(data_nested))

# Create Employee objects for each row in the grouped data
for (i in 1:nrow(data_nested)) {
  emp <- create_employee(
    Employee_ID = data_nested$Employee_ID[i],
    Name = data_nested$Name[i],
    Department = data_nested$Department[i],
    Designation = data_nested$Designation[i],
    Monthly_Sales = data_nested$Monthly_Sales[[i]],
    Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score = data_nested$Monthly_Customer_Feedback_Score[[i]]
  )
  list_of_employees[[i]] <- emp
}

# Group Employee objects by Designation to create Designation objects
designations <- unique(data_nested$Designation)
list_of_designations <- vector("list", length(designations))
names(list_of_designations) <- designations

for (desig in designations) {
  desig_employees <- list_of_employees[sapply(list_of_employees, function(e) e$Designation == desig)]
  desig_obj <- create_designation(Designation_Name = desig, List_of_Employees = desig_employees)
  list_of_designations[[desig]] <- desig_obj
}
```

## Analysis

Now that our data is structured into `Employee` and `Designation` objects, we can perform our analysis. We'll start by examining the performance metrics of each designation. Next, we identify and analyse the top-performing employee within each designation.

```{r}
# For each designation, invoke the print and summary methods to understand its performance metrics.
lapply(list_of_designations, function(desig) {
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
  print(desig)
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
  summary(desig)
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n\n")
})

# Identify the best employee in each designation.
# For the top employee in each designation, invoke their print, summary, and plot methods to showcase their performance.
lapply(list_of_designations, function(desig) {
  top_employee <- desig$List_of_Employees[[which.max(unlist(lapply(desig$List_of_Employees, performance.Employee)))]]
  
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
  cat("Top Employee from the", desig$Designation_Name, "Designation:\n")
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n")
  
  print(top_employee)
  summary(top_employee)
  plot(top_employee, main = paste("Monthly Sales Trend:", top_employee$Name))
  
  cat("---------------------------------------------------\n\n")
})
```

# Conclusions

Based on our analysis, we can draw several conclusions regarding the performance of different designations and their top-performing employees.

As we can see, the **Sales Manager** designation ended the year with the highest average monthly sales, with **Gabriel Brunner** as the most extraordinary employee achieving a stunning 11.62 performance! Good job!

Honorable mention goes to **Sarah Frei** from the **Sales Executive** designation with a performance of 9.59. Well done!
